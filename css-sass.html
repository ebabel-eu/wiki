<pre>==What is Sass?==
  It's a way to parse CSS and re-use portions of it, with nested styles for example.
  
  ==Install Sass on Windows 7==
  Download the recommended stable [http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p448.exe?direct RubyInstaller Ruby 1.9.3-p448] (.exe) from the main [http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ download page].
  
  ===Installation options===
  * Although is optional to install Tcl/Tk support, it's not a bad idea to do so, to create Gui with Ruby. This is nothing to do with Sass though.
  * Add Rub executables to your PATH is a good idea, check it. That way it's possible to run Ruby commands from cmd without browsing to the path where Ruby is installed.
  * Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation. also makes sense. Check it.
  
  ===Install Sass===
  Note: Don't forget to logout and log back in, otherwise your updated PATH environment variables values won't be available yet.
  
  Now that Ruby is installed, in a cmd prompt, run:
  
    gem install sass
  
  Now it's possible to parse an scss file into css, scss being the Sass version of css in your cmd prompt.
  
  For example:
  
    sass --watch style.scss:style.css

  ==Add syntax highlighting to Sublime Text 2 for Sass on Windows==
  
  Get a copy of the latest Syntax highlighting package in a [http://www.cygwin.com/install.html Cygwin prompt] with Git:
  
    git clone https://github.com/n00ge/sublime-text-haml-sass.git sublime-text-haml-sass
    cd sublime-text-haml-sass/
  
  Find out where the Packages are in your copy of Sublime Text 2 with the menu Preferences > Browse Packages
  
  Now you can copy the packages obtained via Git to your Sublime Text 2 packages directory. For example:
  
    cp -R SASS /cygdrive/c/Users/[your username]/AppData/Roaming/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    cp -R Ruby\ Haml /cygdrive/c/Users/[your username]/AppData/Roaming/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
  
  Close all files opened by Sublime Text 2, close all instances of Sublime Text 2 then restart it.
  
  When you open .scss files, they should now be syntax highlighted.
  
  ==Support for IE8 fallbacks in SaSS media queries==
    $mobile: 320; 
    $tablet: 768;
    $desktop: 769;
  
    @mixin mediaquery($point, $IE9: false, $query1: min, $query2: width) {
     @if $IE9 == true{
         .lt-ie9 & {
             @content;
         }
         @media screen and (#{$query1}-#{$query2}: $point / $doc-font-size +em) {
             @content;
         }
     }
     
     @else {
         @media screen and (#{$query1}-#{$query2}: $point / $doc-font-size +em) {
             @content;
         }
     }
    }

  In je css:
  
    @include mediaquery($desktop, true, min) {
      //je code                   
    }
  
  De true parameter zorgt ervoor dat voor je code .lt-ie9 wordt geplaatst, waardoor je ie8 kan ondersteunen.
  
  ==Sass is not watching subdirectories and files in sub folders==
  Solution: rollback Sass to 3.2.0
  
  Windows:
  
  Uninstall newer versions of sass:
  
    gem uninstall sass
  
  Install, or keep, only version 3.2.0
  
    gem install sass -v=3.2.0
  
  Bourbon version to use: also 3.2.0
  
  ==Windows command line==
  In a .bat file or in a command line, run:
  
    START sass --watch --debug-info --line-numbers "screen.scss:../screen.css"
    EXIT
