<pre>Overview
  In recent years I have working mostly with oracle instances using traditional/cooked filesystems i.e. all the datafiles under $ORACLE_BASE/oradata.
  
  However I keep hearing that ASM is the future (there are lots of advantages, which are featured heavily in the Oracle 10g and 11g OCP exams.
  
  I also like using command line tools, as they make the actions so much more transparent and longer term easy to script; so when I am running
  
  Base OS Setup ... Centos 5.8 with 7disc x 4G storage array
  The starting point for this project is
  
  https://github.com/hajee/vagrant-centos-5.10-ora12-rac
  
  This a great github project and using this you can easily build a two node RAC cluster with ASM with much of the Oracle Service deployed via puppet. This degree of automation is undoubtly extremely impressive but a bit more than I current require.
  
  As I want to understand the background infrastructure better, so I'm not going to use puppet i.e. once I have the base Centos 5.8 image up, with the 7disc x 4G storage array up (via rake ... which looks incredibly useful add-on to Vagrant).
  
  Here is the key part of the Rakefile:
  
  ~/projects/ora12asm $ tail -26  Rakefile
  
  desc "Storagetasks"
  namespace :storage do
  
    desc "configure dbasm"
    task :dbasm do
      create_controller('dbasm')
      connect_disks('dbasm')
    end
  
  end
  
  def create_controller(vm)
    puts "Creating controller"
    sh "vboxmanage storagectl #{vm} --add sata --portcount 10 --name 'SATA Controller'"
  end
  
  def connect_disks(vm)
    controller_name = "SATA Controller"
    vdi_files = Dir.glob('*.vdi')
    vdi_files.each_with_index do |vdi_file, no|
      puts "Connect disk #{vdi_file}"
      sh "vboxmanage storageattach #{vm} --storagectl 'SATA Controller' --port #{no} --device 0 --type hdd --medium #{vdi_file} --mtype shareable"
    end
  end
  
  However I'm going to use an old fashioned shell script (provision.sh) for just installing some useful background packages:
  
  ~/projects/ora12asm $ cat provision.sh
  #! /bin/bash
  if [ ! -f /home/vagrant/already-installed-flag ]
  then
    echo "ADD EXTRA ALIAS VIA .bashrc"
    cat /vagrant/bashrc.append.txt >> /home/vagrant/.bashrc
    #echo "GENERAL YUM UPDATE"
    #yum -y update
    #echo "INSTALL GIT"
    #yum -y install git
    echo "INSTALL VIM"
    yum -y -y install vim
    echo "INSTALL TREE"
    yum -y install tree
    echo "INSTALL UNZIP"
    yum  -y install unzip curl wget
    yum -y install perl
    echo "INSTALL SYSSTAT"
    yum -y install sysstat
  
  
  
  else
    echo "already installed flag set : /home/vagrant/already-installed-flag"
  fi
  
  NB The dependent oracle RPMs and setting kernel parameters, which I would typically automate in the provision.sh file are not required as they are in the base "hajee/centos-5.10-x86_64" box image. Although I might at some stage reintroduce this, as I'm want to upgrade to Centos 6. This build is also missing rlwrap (something I typically automate in the provision.sh).
  
  Preparing discs and asmlib
  There is a really good oracle-base.com for this part, it starts from the basic OS setup, including disc array and oracle software install
  
  The article assumes the operating system installation is complete, along with an Oracle software installation. The ASM instance shares the Oracle home with the database instance. If you plan on running multiple database instances on the server the ASM instance should be installed in a separate Oracle home.
  http://oracle-base.com/articles/10g/asm-using-asmlib-and-raw-devices.php
  
  The first step is fdisk, in the old days a sysadmin would do this sort of operation, but the modern DBA is expected to be more versatile.
  
  Firstly running 'fdisk -l' none of the seven /dev/sd* disks have a partition table yet:
  
  [root@ora12asm yum.repos.d]# fdisk -l
  
  Disk /dev/hda: 42.9 GB, 42949672960 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 5221 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
  
     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/hda1   *           1          13      104391   83  Linux
  /dev/hda2              14        5221    41833260   8e  Linux LVM
  
  Disk /dev/sda: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 522 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
  
  Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table
  
  . . .
  
  Disk /dev/sdg: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 522 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
  
  Disk /dev/sdg doesn't contain a valid partition table
  we can rectify this via fdisk
  
  [root@ora12asm vagrant]# fdisk /dev/sda
  Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
  Building a new DOS disklabel. Changes will remain in memory only,
  until you decide to write them. After that, of course, the previous
  content won't be recoverable.

  and now running 'fdisk -l' again:
  
  . . . 
  Disk /dev/sda: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 522 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

  /dev/sda1               1         522     4192933+  83  Linux
  . . .
  after repeating this for all /dev/sd* devices (i.e. 7 discs), we can install the asm related RPMs, note the version of oracleasm-2.6.18-371.el5-2.0.5-1.el5.x86_64.rpm is dependent on the linux kernel version (i.e. from uname -r):
  
  [root@ora12asm yum.repos.d]# uname -r

  [root@ora12asm yum.repos.d]# cd /vagrant/
  [root@ora12asm vagrant]# ls *rpm

  now we configure the ASM library:
  
  [root@ora12asm vagrant]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm configure
  Configuring the Oracle ASM library driver.
  
  This will configure the on-boot properties of the Oracle ASM library
  driver.  The following questions will determine whether the driver is
  loaded on boot and what permissions it will have.  The current values
  will be shown in brackets ('[]').  Hitting <ENTER> without typing an
  answer will keep that current value.  Ctrl-C will abort.
  
  Default user to own the driver interface []: oracle
  Default group to own the driver interface []: oinstall
  Start Oracle ASM library driver on boot (y/n) [n]: y
  Scan for Oracle ASM disks on boot (y/n) [y]:
  Writing Oracle ASM library driver configuration: done
  Initializing the Oracle ASMLib driver:                     [  OK  ]
  Scanning the system for Oracle ASMLib disks:               [  OK  ]
  then use the oracleasm createdisk and scandisks:
  
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL1 /dev/sda1
  Marking disk "VOL1" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL2 /dev/sdb1
  Marking disk "VOL2" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL3 /dev/sdc1
  Marking disk "VOL3" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL4 /dev/sdd1
  Marking disk "VOL4" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL5 /dev/sde1
  Marking disk "VOL5" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL6 /dev/sdf1
  Marking disk "VOL6" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm createdisk VOL7 /dev/sdg1
  Marking disk "VOL7" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm scandisks
  Scanning the system for Oracle ASMLib disks:               [  OK  ]
  finally we can use listdisks
  
  [root@ora12asm shm]# /etc/init.d/oracleasm listdisks

  Installing the Oracle Grid Infrastructure software
  as root setup new oragrid user and asm groups
  This article is GUI based but gives a good overview: http://www.oracledistilled.com/grid-infrastructure/install-oracle-grid-infrastructure-11gr2-with-asm-on-standalone-server/
  
  and I did start by adding the following users:
  
  groupadd asmadmin
  groupadd asmoper
  groupadd asmdba
  useradd -g oinstall -G asmadmin,asmoper,asmdba oragrid
  passwd oragrid
  plus as I think the oracle software was already installs (and in a different group), I added:
  
  chmod g+w /u01
  as oragrid install oracle grid software (linuxamd64_12c_grid)
  Unpack the software (note that the oracle grid sofware must be downloaded from oracle.com as you must sign their eula and them into the root of the project on the host i.e. /vagran):
  
  su - oragrid
  mkdir /u01/grid
  mkdir -p /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1
  
  cd /tmp
  cp /vagrant/linuxamd64_12c_grid_* .
  unzip linuxamd64_12c_grid_1of2.zip
  unzip linuxamd64_12c_grid_2of2.zip
  
  cd grid
  the project includes a response file for installing
  
  [oragrid@ora12asm grid]$ cat /vagrant/oragrid_asm.rsp
  oracle.install.responseFileVersion=/oracle/install/rspfmt_crsinstall_response_schema_v12.1.0
  ORACLE_HOSTNAME=ora12asm

  ORACLE_HOME=/u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1
  oracle.install.asm.OSDBA=oinstall
  oracle.install.asm.OSOPER=asmoper
  oracle.install.asm.OSASM=asmadmin
  oracle.installer.autoupdates.option=SKIP_UPDATES
  and to insstall:
  
  ./runInstaller -silent -ignorePrereq -waitForCompletion -responseFile /vagrant/oragrid_asm.rsp
  as root run root.sh and start stand-alone crs service (ohasd)
  Run root.sh
  
  [root@ora12asm ~]# /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/root.sh
  Check /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/install/root_ora12asm_2015-03-07_11-02-59.log for the output of root script
  [root@ora12asm ~]# cat /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/install/root_ora12asm_2015-03-07_11-02-59.log

     Copying oraenv to /usr/local/bin ...
     Copying coraenv to /usr/local/bin ...
  
  Entries will be added to the /etc/oratab file as needed by
  Database Configuration Assistant when a database is created
  Finished running generic part of root script.
  Now product-specific root actions will be performed.
  
  To configure Grid Infrastructure for a Stand-Alone Server run the following command as the root user:
  /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/perl/bin/perl -I/u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/perl/lib -I/u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/crs/install /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/crs/install/roothas.pl
  
  
  To configure Grid Infrastructure for a Cluster execute the following command as oragrid user:
  /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/crs/config/config.sh
  This command launches the Grid Infrastructure Configuration Wizard. The wizard also supports silent operation, and the parameters can be passed through the response file that is available in the installation media.
  and as we want the Stand-Alone Server:
  
  [root@ora12asm ~]# /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/perl/bin/perl -I/u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/perl/lib -I/u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/crs/install /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1/crs/install/roothas.pl

  as oragrid, we can now run asmca
  Firstly a few sanity checks, for the new inittab entry for ohasd and from ps we can see this currently running
  
  [ora12asm:oragrid:~]$cat /etc/inittab|tail -1

  and now we can install asm:
  
  [ora12asm:oragrid:~]$. oraenv
  ORACLE_SID = [+ASM] ? +ASM
  ORACLE_HOME = [/home/oracle] ? /u01/grid/product/12.1.0/grid_1
