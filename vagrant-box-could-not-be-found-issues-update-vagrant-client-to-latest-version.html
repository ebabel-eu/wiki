<pre>== Summary ==

  After running <code>vagrant up</code> I was hitting  errord like Box X could not be found:
   Box 'generic/debian10' could not be found... URL: ["https://atlas.hashicorp.com/generic/debian10"] ... 404 Not Found
   Box 'debian/buster64' could not be found... URL: ["https://atlas.hashicorp.com/debian/buster64"] ... 404 Not Found
  
  it looks like the URL path now has '''boxes''' in the path e.g. https://app.vagrantup.com/debian/boxes/buster64
  
  I was also running an old laptop and my vagrant client version (1.7.x) was installed several years ago.
  
   '''Upgrading vagrant''' (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to the latest version '''fixed this issue''' ... more details below.

  === Fix Upgrade Vagrant ===
  
  ==== Before ====
  
  I was also running an old laptop and my vagrant version (1.7.4) was installed several years ago.
  
   ~ $ vagrant --version
   Vagrant 1.7.4
  
  ==== After ====
  
  Upgrading vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to the latest version fixed this issue.
  
   ~ $ vagrant --version
   Vagrant 2.2.14
