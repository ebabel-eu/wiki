<pre>==How to run and debug Python on Visual Studio Code==

  ===Youtube demo===
  There is a nice demo of this on youtube by Eric Kwok : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doSPnFks5Vk
  
  ===Sample project - testVisualStudioCodePython===
  
  ====setup tasks.json under .vscode folder====
  However it is pretty simple, under .vscode you need to create a tasks.json file
  
    ~/projects/testVisualStudioCodePython/.vscode $ cat tasks.json
    // Available variables which can be used inside of strings.
    // ${workspaceRoot}: the root folder of the team
    // ${file}: the current opened file
    // ${fileBasename}: the current opened file's basename
    // ${fileDirname}: the current opened file's dirname
    // ${fileExtname}: the current opened file's extension
    // ${cwd}: the current working directory of the spawned process
    // A task runner that calls a custom npm script that compiles the extension.
    {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      // we want to run npm
      "command": "python",
      // the command is a shell script
      "isShellCommand": true,
      // show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.
      "showOutput": "always",
      // we run the custom script "compile" as defined in package.json
      "args": ["${file}"],
      // The tsc compiler is started in watching mode
      //"isWatching": true,
      // use the standard tsc in watch mode problem matcher to find compile problems in the output.
      //"problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch"
    }
  
  ====Exec your python file via CMD+SHIFT+B====
  Next to run, goto you python file in the VSC IDE e.g. :
  
    ~/projects/testVisualStudioCodePython/ $ cat hello_visual_studio_code_test.py
    #!/usr/bin/python
    for i in range(10):
      print str(i) + ' hello world'
  
  and press CMD+SHIFT+B
  
  ===Install Python linting===
    Cmd Shift P
    ext install   <enter>
  
  Type python after ext install then select the extension you want to install i.e. Python which is by far the most popular extension
  
  and from the command line / bash:
  
    sudo python -m pip install astroid
  
  ==Outstanding questions==
  To be honest at this stage, I will be almost as productive in Sublime Text.
  
  Two areas where the VSC IDE doesn't appear to help yet is:
  
  * No IntelliSense
  * No Breakpoints
  
  Although according to https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/overview
  
  + IntelliSense, linting, outline : C++, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, Less, PHP, Python, Sass
